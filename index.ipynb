    "\n",
    "PEP 8 guidelines state that indentations in Python should consist of spaces\n",

    "should be composed of 79 or fewer characters, so we're way off here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports _implicit line joining_ inside of parentheses and brackets,\n",
    "which means that we can add a new line anywhere in our list of arguments as long\n",
